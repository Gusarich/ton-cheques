# TON Cheques

I am not currently working on this project and do not see any point in continuing yet. But I still decided to publish the repository in case it would be useful to someone.

This repository contains a smart contract for one-time TON cheque and a very simple Web UI that allows you to create and claim cheques using TON Wallet extension.

## Building

```bash
npm i @ton-community/func-js
npx func-js stdlib.fc cheque.fc --boc-base64 cheque.base64
```

## Using the Web UI

You can use the Github pages version:
